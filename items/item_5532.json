    "item_description": "Has some damage to it. Never water damaged though. The bottom left corner is a little dented and the top left corner has a scratch. Charges perfectly fine. The screen is coming up though so you will have to replace that but you can find that cheap most anywhere. The home bottom is scratched, like the protective film is scratched off. Originally register through Verizon. It is not unlocked but it is all factory reset. No free ship."
